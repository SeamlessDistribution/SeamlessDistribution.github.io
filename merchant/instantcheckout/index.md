| CreatePurchase | web-shop | [SEQR Instant Checkout](/merchant/reference/instantcheckoutapi.html) | REST service called by SEQR Instant chekout service once user scanned QR Code from web-shop page |
| sendInvoice | SEQR | [SEQR Payment](/merchant/reference/api.html) | SOAP method called by web-shop triggered by CreatePurchase request.

| getPaymentStatus | SEQR | [SEQR Payment](/merchant/reference/api.html) | SOAP method called by web-shop after receiving request to <b>notificationURL</b>. This method will return status of payment.

# Overview of integration steps
To achieve a full integration between SEQR Instant Chekout and web shoop these steps must be covered:

1. Create and expose REST service implementing SEQR Instant Checkout API (CreatePurchase).
API details and test endpointURL can be found [here](/merchant/reference/instantcheckoutapi.html)
2. Implement methods from SEQR Payment API (sendInvoice, getPaymentStatus).
API details and test endpointURL can be found [here](/merchant/reference/api.html)
3. Expose service for notifications (notificationURL)
4. Put SEQR Instant Checkout QRCodes on product details page
5. Test that integration works

# Create and expose REST service
SEQR Instant Checkout API descrition can be found [here](/merchant/reference/instantcheckoutapi.html).
Test creadentials can be found [here](/merchant/reference/signup.html).

# Implement methods from SEQR Payment API
There have to be two methods of SEQR Payment API implemented on your web-shop's backend side - sendInvoice and getPaymentStatus.
More details you can find [here](/merchant/reference/api.html).

# Expose service for notifications
<b>notificationURL</b> is on of the parameters of sendInvoice request. This parameter tells SEQR where to send notification once invoice is paid.
This url has to be unique for diffferent purchases. Let say customer bought product with id 000111222, then your notificationURL can look like this:

{% highlight python %}
   https://your.webshop.domain.com/orderNotif?productId=000111222
{% endhighlight %}

Once your web-shop received such request it should:

Call getPaymentStatus and receive status PAID - this is commit of transaction
Update product stock level.
It would also be good idea to send email with order confirmation to customer.

# Put SEQR Instant Checkout QRCodes on product details page (or anyware you like)
In order to put SEQR Instant Checkout QR codes on your pages you will have to:

1. Import our java script qr code generator
<script src="http://cdn.seqr.com/seqr-services-dev/wss-dev/seqrQRCode-0.0.1.min.js"></script>

2. Put this piece of code on you page:

{% highlight python %}
<div id="qrcode"></div>
  
<script>
    $(document).ready(function() {
        seqrQRCode.qrCode({
            selector: '#qrcode',
            purchaseToken: some_token_recognized_by_webshop,
            webshopId: 'example_shop_id',
            mode: 'demo'
        });
    })
</script>

{% endhighlight %}

# Payment API / WSDL

For test purpose we use this [WSDL](http://extdev4.seqr.se/extclientproxy/service/v2?wsdl).
For complete details, refer to the [API documentation](/downloads/ersifextclient-2.4.2.1-manual-SEQR.pdf)
and to the [javadoc](/downloads/ersifextclient-2.4.2.1-javadoc/).

## Context parameter used in all calls

A principal is the main actor in each request to the SEQR service and represents either a seller or a buyer. Each request has at least an initiator principal.
The ClientContext structure is used in all requests to identify, authenticate and authorize the client initiating the transaction. For authentication the credentials of the initiator principal are used. As all transactions take place over a secure channel (typically HTTPS) the ClientContext is sent in clear text.

<table>
<tr><th>ClientContext fields</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>clientId </td>
    <td> Client id identifies the software with which the SEQR service is communicating, for example â€œCashRegisterManager version 1.3.4.</td></tr>
<tr><td>channel </td>
    <td> The channel used to send a request. Always use ClientWS or WS. </td></tr>
<tr><td>clientRequestTimeout </td>
    <td> The client side timeout for the request. If the response is not received before the timeout the client will attempt to abort the request. Must be set to 0, so there will not be any client forced timeouts in the SEQR service. </td></tr>
<tr><td>initiatorPrincipalId </td>
    <td> Used for authentication of the principal and contains the id and type, as well as an optional user id. 
         Use TERMINALID except when you regsister a new terminal, then you need RESELLERUSER (as provided from seamless). 
    </td></tr>
<tr><td>password</td>
    <td>The password used to authenticate the initiator principal.</td></tr>
<tr><td>clientReference </td>
    <td>The client reference for the transaction.
        Recommended: the clientReference should be unique at least for the specific client id.
        Note: SEQR service does not check this field. The field has a maximum length of 32 characters. 
        The field is mandatory for troubleshooting purposes.
    </td></tr>
<tr><td>clientComment </td>
    <td>Client comment included within the request. Optional.</td></tr>

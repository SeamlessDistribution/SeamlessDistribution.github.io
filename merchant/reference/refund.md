## How to manage refunds

To make a manual refund the process is currently this: 

1. Partner sends an email to Glase Customer Service with a refund request containing the sum of the refund and the ERS-reference number.

2. Glase processes the request and sends a transaction file to the credit account provider.

3. The credit account provider adjusts the end user's account.

4. Glase invoices the partner.

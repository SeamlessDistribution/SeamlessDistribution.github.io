## SEQR in a WebShop

The flow for a webshop SEQR payment is very similar to the [bare-bone SEQR
payment](/merchant/payment) which we saw before. The difference is in details
of how we want a SEQR QR code to be presented on a webshop, for example see the
example below:

<img src="/assets/images/seqr_webshop.png" />

The terminal id and the password are given to a shop when we receive and
validate your request.

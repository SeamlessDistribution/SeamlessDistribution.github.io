Get SEQR app
=============

For testing purposes we have a test server and test app that you can play with
on your phone. Android app is the only platform that is available for public
 development purposes. 

#### 1. Download and install the app

Our Android developer app can be installed if you enable "other sources" in 
settings and then browse to this page on your phone [install android developer
app](/downloads/se-qr-androidapp-demo-2.1.8.3-aligned.apk).

#### 2. Once installed, make sure that "Extdev 4" is selected as server, and accept the Terms of Service:

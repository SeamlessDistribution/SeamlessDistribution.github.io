Get SEQR app
=============

For testing purposes we have a test server and test app that you can play with
on your phone. Android app is the only platform that is available for public
 development purposes. For iPhone and other apps, please [contact](/contact) us.

* Our Android developer app can be installed if you enable "other sources" in 
settings and then browse to this page on your phone [install android developer
app](/downloads/se-qr-androidapp-demo-2.1.8.3-aligned.apk).

* Once installed you make sure that "Extdev 4" is selected as server:

Get SEQR app
=============

For development and demo purposes we have a test server and test app that you can play with
on your phone. Android app is the only platform that is available for public development and demo purposes.

The instruction below describes how to get access to the development app, that is through our **Extdev** server.



#### 1. Download and install the app

Our Android developer app can be installed if you enable "other sources" in
settings and then browse to this page on your phone [install android developer
app](http://extdev.seqr.com/app/android/).

#### 2. Once installed, make sure that "Extdev" is selected as server, and accept the Terms of Service:

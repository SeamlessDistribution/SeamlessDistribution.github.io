* in any manner that is not expressly authorised in the Terms & Conditions;
* to modify, edit, disassemble, decompile or reverse-engineer the SAPI;

##6. Term and termination
Your right to use the SAPI shall commence on the date upon which you agree to the Terms & Conditions or otherwise commence use of any portion of the SAPI, and shall continue in force thereafter unless terminated as hereinafter provided.

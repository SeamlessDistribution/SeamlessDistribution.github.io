## SEQR Payments

Paying with SEQR is super easy, so we would like it to be integration firendly too.
To get started, you need an app connected to the test servers, and then you can
start sending invoices and pay them to see the magic:
 
* [Getting SEQR mobile application](app)
* [Making the first SEQR payment](merchant/payment) 
* [How can I get paid?](merchant)
{% include payment_channels.md %}

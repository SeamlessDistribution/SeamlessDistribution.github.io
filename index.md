## SEQR Payments

Paying with SEQR is super easy, so we would like it to be integration friendly too.
To get started, you need an app connected to the test servers, and then you can
start sending invoices and pay them to see the magic:
 
* [Getting SEQR mobile application](app)
* [Making the first SEQR payment](merchant/payment) 
* [How can I get paid?](merchant)

## Payment scenarios

Now you can start exploring different ways of using payments 

* [Webshop](/merchant/webshop)
   * [In-app Payments: in my smartphone app](/merchant/inapp)
* [Physical Point-Of-Sale (POS): in a physical store](/merchant/pos)
* [Service, web purchase through the app: through TV commercials, Ads or even parking places!](/merchant/externalservices)
